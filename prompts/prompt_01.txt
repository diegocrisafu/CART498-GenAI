A breathtaking, hyperrealistic collage in the style of Max Ernst, depicting a majestic, ancient mushroom forest at twilight. The mushrooms are bioluminescent, emitting a soft, otherworldly glow in shades of deep blue and emerald green. In the center, a wise, old, Pixar-style cat sage with luminous eyes sits in a meditative pose on a giant mushroom cap, its fur adorned with tiny, sparkling mushrooms. The cat sage is surrounded by an aura of mystical energy, represented by swirling, colorful smoke and intricate, glowing patterns. The scene evokes a sense of deep tranquility and ancient wisdom, with a focus on intricate detail, realistic textures, and a dreamlike atmosphere. The color palette should be dominated by deep blues, greens, and purples, with accents of gold and silver.}
